# Style Guide
## JavaScript
Functions must be descriptive and meaningful. Comments should explain code and logic (including in EJS).
Try to avoid horizontal scrolling.
```
// Functions should use camelCase and indents (2 spaces/VSCode tab default)
function functionName{
  // Explain what is occuring.
  something();
}
```
## HTML
Use comments to describe parts of webpage.
